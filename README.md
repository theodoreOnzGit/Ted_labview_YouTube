Some instructions:


Install notes:
When installing labview, I used Linux Mint 20 (Ulyana) to install.
Labview only supports RedHat, OpenSUSE and scientific Linux. However, i was able to get it done on Linux Mint 20, an Ubuntu based distro.

I used a student edition, so install instructions may differ for different campuses or license holders.

The idea for the linux iso is to navigate to the iso directory and run:

sudo sh ./INSTALL

this will install labview into 

/usr/local/natinst

For Linux Mint Debian Edition 4 (LMDE 4, Debbie), i have not been able to get it to install or run right as of 21 sep 2020.
Not going to try for sake of time

This was the closest guide for installing labview on Debian 10 buster, which should work on LMDE 4 as well since it's based on Debian.
